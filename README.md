# react-shop

This is an e-shop made with Javascript and React. This repo contains a custom Webpack and Babel Config.

This is a project based on a online course, this was made to learn React. 

Whenever I start a new project, I don't know what to write for the first commit. After doing a “git init” there is technically nothing there...

## Install

```npm
npm install
```

# Usage

To run the project: 

```npm
npm run start
// This runs webpack serve --open, which opens the project in a browser.
```
